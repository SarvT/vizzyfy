### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 12+ recommended).
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is compatible with multiple package managers (e.g., npm, yarn, or pnpm).

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Use your preferred package manager to install project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Vite development server to launch the application locally.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Open in Browser**

   By default, the application will be available at:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

6. **Build for Production (Optional)**

   If you need to build the app for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   # or
   pnpm build
   ```

7. **Preview the Production Build (Optional)**

   You can preview the production build locally:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   # or
   yarn preview
   # or
   pnpm preview
   ```
